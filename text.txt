ramadan, the ninth month of the Muslim calendar, is one of the most sacred times for Muslims. It is the month in which it is believed that the Holy Qur'an was sent down from heaven "as a guidance for men and women, a declaration of direction, and a means of salvation."

During this month, Muslims observe a strict fast from dawn until sunset. They are not allowed to eat or drink (even water) during daylight hours. Fasting is a private act of worship bringing about nearness to God, as well as a form of spiritual discipline and a means to empathize with those less fortunate. The fast is broken at the end of the day with prayer and a festive meal called an iftar. It is customary to visit family and friends following the iftar.

During Ramadan, many Muslims go to the mosque and spend several hours praying. In addition to the five daily prayers that are part of the core of Islam, Muslims recite a special prayer called the Tarawih prayer (night prayer).

On the evening of the 27th day of Ramadan, Muslims observe a special night called Layat al-Qadr, sometimes referred to as the Night of Power. It is believed that Muhammad first received the Holy Qur'an on this night.

At the end of Ramadan, Eid al-Fitr celebrates the breaking of the fast. Friends and families gather for festive meals and exchange gifts. Special gifts are also given to the poor.28 29 20 50 40 2005 20006
